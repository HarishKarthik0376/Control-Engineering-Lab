            <p class="details1">To demonstrate the technique of block reduction to simply complex systems by using illustration in virtual lab.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="details1">In this experiment the overall transfer function of the complicated system can be obtained. The block diagram given for the system may be connected in parallel and cascade. In between the blocks there may be summing point or branch point. The summing points add or subtract the two and more than two signals. The signal from the blocks goes concurrently to other blocks through branch points or summing points. The main elements of the block diagram are blocks, summing point and branch point or take off point. In the block diagram approach all system variables are linked to each other through functional blocks. The transfer functions of each component are represented in the blocks. All the blocks carries individual component transfer function are connected through arrow lines to indicate the direction of the flow of signals. The overall transfer function of the system can be obtained by applying block diagram reduction rules. The rules are framed in such a way that any modification done on the block diagram not affect the relations between the input and output of the each blocks.</p>
